                <p><b>Putting the Needs of the Patient First</b>
                Mayo Clinic’s laboratories view testing as an integrated part of each patient’s episode of care. Our assays and algorithms are jointly developed by Mayo Clinic laboratory experts and Mayo Clinic physicians around each patient’s medical diagnosis and treatment. This algorithmic approach ensures that you receive the right test for the right patient at the right time.</p>
                <p><b>Sharing our Knowledge</b>
                For more than 150 years, Mayo Clinic has collaborated with health care organizations around the world to advance medical knowledge and support the local delivery of health care services. To ensure success in a value-based payment environment, our laboratory physicians and scientists regularly interact with their clinical peers to ensure that the right tests are developed, validated, and implemented for the clinical practice.

                To build on this legacy, Mayo Clinic subject-matter experts provide on-site guidance, consultative services, on-demand educational opportunities, and utilization management tools. These tools will enable your organization to continually evolve with the changes of health care reform.</p>
